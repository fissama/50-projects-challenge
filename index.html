          Set on the planet Regnus, the world of Blue Protocol is filled with a
          mysterious light called Engram. An ancient civilization, known as the
          Bafarians, have been relegated to nothing more than myths and stories,
          and their once-proud cities are now ancient dilapidated ruins.
        </p>

          There are currently four classes to choose from, and the developers
          say they are already working on more as well. Currently, the four
          classes are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Aegis Fighter</li>
          <li>Twin Striker</li>
          <li>Blast Archer</li>
          <li>Spellcaster</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Blue Protocol is slated for a Japan-only release later this year, but
          Bandai Namco has said that they are looking into a global expansion
          and is currently hiring for an English localization director. Blue
          Protocol is currently in closed beta status.
